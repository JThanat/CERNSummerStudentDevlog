- Try to install Mesos on the local Machine. And talk with Jim about new design when we discuss how the Mesos offers the resource to their framework.
- Research if it is possible to implement the new design with Mesos or not. [The new design is to let the Mesos framework know about their resource immediately by resource's `dataset` and `groupid` and let the Mesos master spawns new workers if there are no available resource for the framework. ]
